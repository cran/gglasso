\title{Simplified gene expression data from Alon et al. (1999)}
\format{An object of class \code{list} of length 2.}
\source{
The data are described in Alon et al. (1999) and can be freely
downloaded from
\url{http://microarray.princeton.edu/oncology/affydata/index.html}.
}
\usage{
colon
}
\value{
A list with the following elements: \item{x}{a [62 x 100] matrix
(expanded from a [62 x 20] matrix) giving the expression levels of 20 genes
for the 62 colon tissue samples. Each row corresponds to a patient, each 5
consecutive columns to a grouped gene.} \item{y}{a numeric vector of length
62 giving the type of tissue sample (tumor or normal).}
}
\description{
Gene expression data (20 genes for 62 samples) from the microarray
experiments of colon tissue samples of Alon et al. (1999).
}
\details{
This data set contains 62 samples with 100 predictors (expanded from 20
genes using 5 basis B-splines, as described in Yang, Y. and Zou, H. (2015)):
40 tumor tissues, coded 1 and 22 normal tissues, coded -1.
